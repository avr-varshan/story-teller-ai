Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Metropolis, Superman discovered a mysterious old map hidden within the pages of an ancient book. The map pointed to an enchanted forest outside the city, where legends spoke of a magical horse with incredible powers. His curiosity piqued, Superman decided to embark on this adventure.

As Superman ventured deeper into the forest, he heard a soft neigh. Following the sound, he came face to face with Starlight. The horse stood regally, her ears perked up and eyes twinkling with curiosity. Superman approached gently, extending a hand with a friendly smile. Starlight nuzzled his hand, and with a leap, Superman mounted her back.
